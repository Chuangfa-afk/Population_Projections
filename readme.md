# Visualizing UN Population Projections

## Project Overview

"Visualizing UN Population Projections" is a comprehensive analysis project focused on the World Population Prospects dataset, specifically the 2015 revision by the UN Department of Social and Economic Affairs, Population Division. This project aims to provide insightful visualizations and analyses of population projections on various scales, ranging from global to national levels.

## Key Features

- **Data Preparation**: Utilizes the UN's medium variant projections, with options to explore alternative scenarios like the "constant fertility" projections.
- **Analysis at Different Scales**: Examines data at both the continental and national scales, providing a multifaceted view of population changes.
- **Line Chart Visualization**: Presents population changes over time in a clear and interpretable line chart format.
- **Choropleth Map Visualization**: Depicts geographical population changes using choropleth maps for easy comprehension of regional trends.
- **Descriptive Tables**: Offers detailed tables describing various aspects of the population data for in-depth analysis.

## Data Source

The dataset comes from the [UN Department of Social and Economic Affairs, Population Division](http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DVD/). It includes comprehensive population data, with a focus on the UN's medium variant projections. The project also references [ISO country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_numeric) for accurate geographical analysis.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab installed.
3. Open the `visualize-population-projections.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
4. Install any necessary Python packages as outlined in the notebook.

## Usage

Follow these steps within the Jupyter Notebook:

1. Run the initial cells to prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. Explore the visualizations at different scales â€“ from continental to national.
3. Interact with the choropleth maps for a geographical perspective on population changes.
4. Utilize the descriptive tables for detailed demographic insights.

## Built With

- **Python**: Primary programming language for analysis and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive computational environment.
- **Visualization Libraries**: Python libraries for creating line charts, choropleth maps, and tables: Matplotlib, Plotly, Pandas
